## Version 1: The Hook (15-30 seconds)

**[SCREEN RECORD YOUR PHONE — open go.html and click through the widget]**

**Voiceover while scrolling:**

"If you own a tattoo shop, stop answering 'how much for a tattoo' in your DMs."

**[Tap "Palm" size, tap "Traditional", tap "Full Color"]**

"I built this free widget that sits on your website. Customer picks their size, style, placement..."

**[Tap "Get My Estimate" — show the price range]**

"...and gets an instant price range. Based on YOUR rates. Then hits Book a Consultation and you get a serious lead instead of a tire kicker."

**[Scroll down to show "Powered by Shop Estimator"]**

"It's free. One line of code. Works on any website. Link in bio."

**[END]**

## Version 2: The Problem/Solution (30-45 seconds)

**[Face camera first 5 seconds]**

"Every tattoo shop owner I know spends half their day answering the same question."

**[Cut to text on screen: "how much for a small tattoo on my wrist?"]**
**[Stack more texts:]**
- "what would a half sleeve run me?"
- "how much for a portrait?"
- "can you do a small one for like $50?"

**[Cut to phone screen recording of widget]**

"So I built this. Free pricing widget. Sits right on your website."

**[Click through it fast]**

"Customer picks everything — size, style, color, placement — gets a price range in 10 seconds. Then books a consultation. Done."

"You stop being a human calculator. They stop guessing. Everyone wins."

**[Face camera]**

"Link in bio. It's free. Takes 60 seconds to install. I don't care if you're on WordPress, Squarespace, whatever — it works."

**[END]**

## Version 3: The Build Story (45-60 seconds)

**[Screen recording of code + widget side by side]**

"I built a free tool for small businesses in one weekend and I'm giving it away."

"It's a pricing estimator widget. You paste one line of code on your website and your customers can estimate their own price."

**[Show tattoo config]**

"Started with tattoo shops — size, style, placement, color — but it's config-driven so I made versions for hair salons, nail shops, and auto detailers too."

**[Show the 4 vertical cards from go.html]**

"The whole thing is free. No account. No subscription. No catch."

**[Show affiliate products section]**

"I make a few bucks if someone buys aftercare products through the recommendations. That's it. That's the business model."

"If you own any kind of service business, link in bio. 60 seconds to install."

**[END]**
